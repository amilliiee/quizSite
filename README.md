# Title

This quiz is a recreation of a group project that was completed during the first course of a full stack bootcamp with a few changes. The original quiz site was a basic HTML site, and the goal here was to convert it into a React App.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
